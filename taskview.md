# Taskview: Project workflow

Brainstorming how to organize a taskview proposal focused on CRAN packages that facilitate project workflow. The packages are organized into approximate categories, but many have features that define the other categories as well.

## Utilities

These packages provide single-use functions to implement project infrastructure.

* [rrtools][]
* [usethis][]

[rrtools]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=rrtools
[usethis]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=usethis

## Frameworks

These packages provide an organized directory structure and helper functions to assist during the development of the project.

* [adapr][]
* [exreport][]
* [makeProject][]
* [projectTemplate][]
* [reports][]
* [represtools][]
* [RSuite][]
* [tinyProject][]
* [workflowr][]
* [zoon][]

[adapr]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=adapr
[exreport]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=exreport
[makeProject]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=makeProject
[projectTemplate]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=projectTemplate
[reports]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=reports
[represtools]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=represtools
[RSuite]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=RSuite
[tinyProject]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=tinyProject
[workflowr]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=workflowr
[zoon]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=zoon

## Pipelines

These packages implement complex pipelines for processing data in a series of interdependent steps.

* [drake][]
* [repo][]

[drake]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=drake
[repo]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=repo

## Dependency and environment management

These packages help manage the computational environment for running the project code.

* [liftr][]
* [packrat][]
* [switchr][]

[liftr]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=liftr
[packrat]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=packrat
[switchr]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=switchr
